# ToDoList-ReactNative

This is my First React Native App.

React Native (also known as RN) is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase.

In this project I am creating an TO-DO-LIST app using React Native.
